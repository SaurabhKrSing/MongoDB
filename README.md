### How does MongoDB store data

MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, a binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents. These documents are stored in collections within databases.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

### What is BSON Data

BSON (Binary JSON) is the binary-encoded serialization format used by MongoDB to store and transmit data. It extends JSON with additional data types such as ObjectId, Date, and binary data, optimizing storage and efficiency. BSON supports rich data structures and is essential for MongoDB's document-oriented storage and querying capabilities.

### What is Difference between BSON and JSON

Here's a comparison of BSON (Binary JSON) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in a table format:

| **Feature**       | **JSON**                                                                          | **BSON**                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Format**        | Text-based                                                                        | Binary                                                                         |
| **Data Types**    | Limited (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null)                       | Extended (includes additional types like dates, binary data)                   |
| **Readability**   | Human-readable                                                                    | Not human-readable (binary format)                                             |
| **Efficiency**    | Larger size, less efficient for storage and transmission of large volumes of data | Smaller size, more efficient for storage and transmission due to binary format |
| **Usage**         | Typically used for data interchange between systems, configuration files          | Specifically designed for MongoDB storage and network communication            |
| **Support**       | Widely supported by many programming languages and systems                        | Supported primarily by MongoDB and its drivers                                 |
| **Null Values**   | Supports `null` values                                                            | Supports `null` values                                                         |
| **Extensions**    | No extensions beyond the core JSON data types                                     | Extends JSON with additional data types like ObjectId, Date, Binary Data       |
| **Usage Context** | General-purpose data interchange format                                           | Specifically tailored for database storage and querying (MongoDB)              |

### What is Collections

**Collections**: Groups of MongoDB documents, equivalent to tables in relational databases, but without a fixed schema.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

### What is Document

**Document**: A single record in a MongoDB collection, stored in JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

### What is Collection

**Collection**: A grouping of MongoDB documents, similar to a table, but more flexible and schema-less.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What is Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing schema-based data validation and query building.

A library that creates a connection between MongoDB and Node.js JavaScript Runtime Environment. It is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) Library.

**Note :**

- Mongoose uses Operation Buffering.
- Mongoose lets you start using your models immediately, without waiting for mongoose to establish a connection to monogoDB.

### What is Schema

A schema defines the structure and constraints of data in a database, specifying fields, types, and relationships within tables or documents.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

### What are Dynamic Schemas

Dynamic schemas in MongoDB allow documents in the same collection to have different structures, enabling flexible and evolving data models.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

---

### What is Models

Models define and manage data access, representing documents and enabling interaction with the database using schemas.

### What do you mean by Transactions

A transaction is a logical unit of processing in a database that includes one or more database operations, which can be read or write operations. Transactions provide a useful feature in MongoDB to ensure consistency.

MongoDB provides two APIs to use transactions.

**Core API:** It is a similar syntax to relational databases (e.g., start_transaction and commit_transaction)
**Call-back API:** This is the recommended approach to using transactions. It starts a transaction, executes the specified operations, and commits (or aborts on the error). It also automatically incorporates error handling logic for "TransientTransactionError" and "UnknownTransactionCommitResult".
